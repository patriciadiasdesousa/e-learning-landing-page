## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Combination of SMACSS and BEM CSS architecture

### What I learned

- How to use a CSS architecture framework to organize styles in a way that is flexible but easy to reference. I adapted the SMACSS architecture to my project by creating a specific section for RESET and TYPOGRAPHY Rules.

```css

/* Site Stylesheet
  1. RESET
  2. BASE
  3. LAYOUT
  4. TYPOGRAPHY
  5. MODULE
  6. STATE
  */
  
}
```
- How to adapt BEM methodology naming rules with SMACSS achitecture.

- How to plan the website structure using semantic HTML

### Continued development

- Continue to test BEM and SMACSS together to see how well it adapts with more complex layouts.
